 * @class MuPlayer
 *
 * @brief MuPlayer Class
 *
 * @details
 *
 * INTRO:
 *
 * MuPlayer is the only class in the MuM Library realtime
 * playback module. Playback is  done with MIDI and
 * can be directed to any enabled MIDI destinations in the system.
 * Normally only a single Player object is needed to play various
 * materials within the lifetime of a MuM based application.
 * MuPlayer assigns MuMaterial objects to playback queues and
 * schedules them for playback. A queue can be scheduled
 * using one of two ways: normal mode or game mode. In normal mode
 * queues are scheduled for immediate playback. In game mode, client
 * code registers a callback function which the Player will call
 * when it needs a new material to keep playback going.
 *
 * Alternatively, any MuMaterial can be played from code with
 * Csound by calling PlaybackWithCsound() on the object to be
 * heard. However this call is synchronous and it starts
 * a system level process which will play the entire length
 * of the material before returning control to the Library.
 * MIDI playback with MuPlayer,on the other hand, can
 * be used at any time during without blocking an application
 * execution flow.
 *
 * @note
 * currently only normal playback mode is implemented
 * Game Mode is TBD. (check the MuM Library
 * page on GitHub frequently for new functionality).
 *
 * INITIALIZATION:
 *
 * Before being used, an MuPlayer needs to be
 * initialized. This initialization creates the necessary
 * infrastructure for the player to interact with the MIDI
 * system in the current platform. Initialization is done
 * with a call to Init(). When using CoreMIDI (Mac OS), Init()
 * creates a MIDI client and an output port associated with
 * it. It also verifies the available MIDI destinations at the
 * moment of the call and displays a list of destinations in
 * standard output (std::cout). By default, Init() selects the
 * first available destination, but this choice can be overruled
 * with a subsequent call to SelectMIDIDestination(). Init() also
 * starts the scheduler thread which is responsible for actually
 * sending the MIDI events. ResetMIDI() releases all MIDI
 * resources created by Init(). After this call, the Player
 * needs to be initialized again in order be usable.
 * Linux implementation behaves ina similar manner
 * but using RtMIDI (ALSA). To opt between Mac/Linux
 * compilation, there is a macro definition in MIDI.h.
 * Currently there is no Windows implementation of MuPlayer.
 *
 * Once initialized, the player can receive requests
 * to play musical materials with calls to Play(). This method
 * takes an MuMaterial as argument and passes the material to
 * a working queue. It also takes a choice of playback
 * mode, which determines when/how the materials will be played.
 * Assuming the player has been initialized beforehand,
 * Play() can be called at any time during program execution.
 *
 * PLAYBACK CONTROLS:
 *
 * MuPlayer can be used to pause, resume or stop
 * playback. It is possible to pause/resume/stop an individual
 * (playback queue) or the entire playback system. See Pause()
 * and Stop() for more details on how to use the playback
 * controls of MuPlayer.
 *
 * UNDER THE HOOD
 *
 * In order to allow many materials to playback simultaneously,
 * MuPlayer employs Posix Threads. The class contains a scheduler thread
 * and several working queue threads. The queue threads are initiated
 * when a request for playback is made. They strip the input materials
 * extracting MIDI events, put them in chronological order inside a
 * MIDI event queue and flag the queue as active. The scheduler, on
 * the other hand, starts when the player is initialized and keeps 
 * looking for active queues in the pool. For every active queue, it finds
 * the next pending event and checks its timestamp. If it is expired the
 * scheduler sends it. Then it moves to the next active queue and so on,
 * until the applications terminates or the player is paused, stopped or
 * reset. When the scheduler reaches the last event in a queue, it
 * resets the queue and marks it as inactive, so it can be used again
 * by the player.
 *
 * The player comunicates to its threads through one-way flags.
 * Only the working queue thread can set the active flag and it only
 * does that once, when the event queue is filled up. After that the 
 * working queue thread will terminate. Only the scheduler thread
 * will read this flag and turn it off when the event queue is completely
 * empty. Only the player will look for inactive queue so it can 
 * play another material. The playback controls are
 * implemented using this same type of mechanism. Each queue has a
 * pause flag which can only be set by the player and read by the
 * scheduler thread. When the scheduler detects an acitve queue,
 * it checks to see if it is paused. If it is, and there is a pending event
 * to be played, it discards it, unless it is a noteOff event.
 * if the entire player is paused, the scheduler ignores all queues
 * and just idles for a few microseconds before checking again.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *
 * When using MuPlayer for playback with MuM, it is necessary
 * to define a MIDI channel for each voice to be played, which can
 * be done with SetChannel(). Once the channel is set, instrument
 * choices can be made with a call to SendProgramChange()
 * to each individual channel, before calling  Play(). This
 * assumes  the synthesizer on the other side of the MIDI
 * setup understands GM requests. Any other required messages
 * during MIDI playback can be delivered by SendMIDIEvents().
 *
 * Normal workflow for playback with MuM can be summarized by
 * the following code sample:
 *
 * @code {.cpp}
 *
 * MuPlayer player;
 * player.Init();
 * //...
 * MuMaterial mat;
 * mat.MajorScale(0.5);
 * mat.SetChannel(0,1);
 * player.SendProgramChange(0,72); // flute (GM)
 * player.Play(mat, PLAYBACK_MODE_NORMAL);
 * //...
 * player.Pause(true); // pause playback
 * //...
 * player.Pause(false); // resume playback
 * //...
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note
 * Currently, only PLAYBACK_MODE_NORMAL is implemented.
 *
 * @warning
 *
 * MuPlayer's playback queue pool is allocated at compile time.
 * Its size is limited by the MAX_QUEUES constant. Depending
 * on expected density of materials in the application, it may
 * be necessary to increase this value before compiling. Otherwise,
 * once all queues in the pool are in use, requests to play new
 * materials may not be honored.
