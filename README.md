# MuM
This is the main repository for the MuM (Music Material) project. MuM is a C++ Library for  algorithmic composition. 

MuM's design is based on a traditional model of representing music events as notes. the Library's main class defines a "Music Material", an object that can encapsulate any combination of notes, from a single interval to a melodic line, a chord progression or a full score with multiple voices/instruments. The Library uses C++'s object-oriented features to implement intuitive ways of manipulating music information, like adding two phrases, merging melody and harmony, transposing a motive, etc.

This Library was created by Dr. Carlos Eduardo Mello, at Universidade de Brasília in 2009. The original implementation is described in an article written for ANPPOM 2009*. It was made into a public project starting November 2015. The MuM Project is currently maintained by the University of Brasilia Music Department Computer Music Group (Nucleo de Computação Musical / NCM-UnB).

Documentation for MuM is generated from the source code comments using Doxigen, which produces a complete reference in HTML format. A zipped copy of the updated HTML files is kept in this repository under mum-docs.zip

* A copy of this paper is included in the repository for reference: MuM.pdf.
