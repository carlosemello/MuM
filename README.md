# MuM
This is the main repository for the MuM (Music Material) project. MuM is a C++ Library for algorithmic composition. 

MuM's design is based on a traditional model of representing music events as notes. the Library's main class defines a "Music Material", an object that can encapsulate any combination of notes, from a single interval to a melodic line, a chord progression or a full score with multiple voices/instruments. The Library uses C++'s object-oriented features to implement intuitive ways of manipulating music information, like adding two phrases, merging melody and harmony, transposing a motive, etc.

This Library was created by Dr. Carlos Eduardo Mello, at Universidade de Brasília in 2009. The original implementation is described in an article written for ANPPOM 2009. It was made into a public project starting November 2015. The MuM Project is currently maintained by the University of Brasilia Music Department Computer Music Group (Nucleo de Computação Musical / NCM-UnB).

Documentation:

For help compiling code with MuM look for the MuM Tutorial in the documentation repository at https://github.com/carlosemello/MuMDocs. Reference Documentation for the library is generated from the source code comments using Doxigen, which produces a complete reference in HTML format. A zipped copy of the updated HTML files is kept in the MuM documentation repository . A copy of the MuM/ANPPOM article mentioined above is also included in the documention repository for reference (MuM.pdf).
