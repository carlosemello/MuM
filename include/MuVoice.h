 *
 * a voice  represents an individual sequence
 * of notes inside a music material object, which
 * in turn may contain any number of voices
 *
 * Besides the notes themselves, the voice contains
 * information about instrument choice:
 * an instrument number and an integer accounting for the
 * number of parameters required for each note in the sequence
 * to be correctly rendered by the referred instrument.
 * As explainned in note.h, the parameters are all floats
 * and should be contained in an MuParamBlock within each note
 *
 * Optionally, the voice may also contain a string with 
 * the instrument's code, for Csound rendering.

 * @class MuVoice
 *
 * @brief Voice Class
 *
 * @details
 * An MuVoice object represents an individual sequence of notes inside an MuMaterial 
 * (music material) object, which in turn may contain any number of voices. The voice, as 
 * defined here, is analogous to a part in a musical score, but it may contain any number of 
 * simultaneous notes. Therefore an MuVoice can contain the entire composition and may be 
 * the only voice within a given material (see MuMaterial below). Tipically, however, voices 
 * are used to store the notes to be played by individual instruments. Thus, besides the notes 
 * themselves, a voice contains information about instrument choice -- an instrument number 
 * and an integer accounting for the number of parameters required for each note in the 
 * sequence, so that these can be correctly rendered by the referred instrument. As explained 
 * in MuNote.h, parameters other than the ones directly defined in the note class,  are always 
 * floats and should be contained in an MuParamBlock within each note. 
 *
 * The MuVoice class is an internal implementation detail and should not be used directly by 
 * user code. It is documented here in oder to facilitate comprehension of MuM Library and 
 * maintenance of internal code. All the voice functionality is acessessible through the 
 * MuMaterial's interface.
