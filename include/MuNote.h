/**
 * @class MuNote
 *
 * @brief Note Class
 *
 * @details
 *
 * MuNote is the most basic musical unit of the MuM composition library. 
 * It is used by every class/layer in MuM to represent discrete sonic events 
 * which can be manipulated by the library's various methods. 
 
 * An MuNote is designed to be output with a standard Csound line layout, 
 * where instrument choice, start time and duration are mandatory; 
 * besides these three pieces of data, two more fields constitute regular data members:
 * pitch and amplitude. Pitch is represented as an integer in the the form of a 
 * MIDI note number (Middle-C = 60) in order to facilitate interval manipulation. 
 * At "string output time", each pitch is converted to Csound pitch notation using 
 * the CsPitch() method and output as the fourth parameter (p4) in every note line. 
 * Amplitude is used to designate overall intensity for the note.
 * Amplitude is stored as a float value between 0 and 1.0. 
 * When output to a Csound score this data member is placed on the 
 * fifth parameter (p5) of each note line. When MIDI output is used, 
 * this value is converted to a 7 bit integer (0-127) and used as 
 * key velocity for each NoteOn event.
 * 
 * Other parameters are defined as floats and placed in an MuParamBlock as needed.
 * However, decisions as to the meaning of each parameter in the block are left to 
 * higher levels on the layer hierarchy (see voice.h, material.h). 
 * Notes only carry these parameters around so they can be used by other classes.
