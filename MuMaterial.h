/** @mainpage MuM
 * @details 
 MuM is an algorithmic composition framework.  This framework was developed to 
 facilitate the manipulation of music information, when implementing music composition 
 algorithms. The framework is designed around the concept of “Musical Material”, an open 
 designation for any length of musical information which can be manipulated in order to 
 create more complex musical information. In this sense, music material can be a motive, a 
 melody, a chord, a multi-voiced choral, a complete orchestral piece or a single musical 
 interval. In another words, any data from which a composer could extract musical ideas 
 for new compositions. MuM models this idea in a class of objects which can store any 
 combination of notes and voices. 
 
 MuM is based on a discrete concept of sonic events, in which a composition is ultimately 
 represented  as organized groups of notes. Furthermore, even though there is support for 
 manipulating and storing timbre information, the main focus is on pitch and rhythm 
 organization. Thus, the framework is not particularly useful for music which is centered 
 on continuous transformation of sound. The framework is built with standard (ANSI) 
 C++. Therefore it is easily portable to various platforms in source code form. Its output 
 may consist of either Csound score files or Standard MIDI Files. 
 
 MuM is free software. It may be copied, modified and reused in any way, as long as it 
 retains the credits for the original developers (as noted in this document and in source 
 code) in the derived work's source and documentation files. The original MuM 
 implementation was writen by Carlos Eduardo Mello, at the University of Brasilia.

/**
 * @class MuMaterial
 *
 * @brief Musical Material Class
 *
 * @details
 * MuMaterial is the most important class in MuM. It embodies the main design idea for the 
 * framework, that of a flexible object which may contain any number/combination of notes, 
 * distributed in voices. It is through this object that the user accesses, modifies, copies and 
 * otherwise manipulates the notes, in order to create specific algorithms for composition. 
 * MuMaterial supports a number of methods for inserting notes, copying entire voices, 
 * loading score files. It offers several basic transfomations of its internal data, such as 
 * transposition, time scaling, inversion, retrogradation, concatenation, mixing, and more. 
 * The entries in this reference manual explain in detail the interface for each of these 
 * methods. The remaining of this section will clarify some general aspects of the class's 
 * design and its overall features. 
 * 
 * Voices inside Materials 
 *  
 * MuMaterial features methods which allows the user to organize its internal structure in 
 * separate voices, for use with diferent instruments or tracks. However, while these 
 * methods include facilities for most desirable routine operations, like  creating, removing, 
 * copying and clearing each voice independently, the API use is often more intuitive when 
 * these tasks are handled transparently by the object. MuMaterial was designed to required 
 * as little specification as possible from the user, when acessing each of its features. In order 
 * for this to be acomplished, most methods are overloaded so that there is usually a general 
 * call which applies transformations to the entire contents of the object (or to voice 0) and 
 * another, or others, which direct action to specific voices within the object. This way, if user 
 * code uses only "general-flavor" calls, it will be operating on the more intuitive scope - 
 * either everything, or when it makes sense, a single default voice.  
 * 
 * Errors inside Materials 
 * 
 * MuM classes handle internal errors by pasing error objects along the object hierarchy. 
 * Every call that involves memory allocation, or which may be subject to questionable 
 * requests (e.g.: invalid indexes and such) return error codes within an MuError object. 
 * Normaly, this kind of design should be incorporated into every part of a framework so 
 * that calling code can consistently keep track of what is happening inside it. However, in 
 * order to comply with the original idea of making the framework intuitive and easy to use, 
 * MuMaterial was built to handle errors diferently. Every time and error condition is 
 * reached within an MuMaterial method, this condition is temporarily reported by storing 
 * the corresponding error code in an internal MuError instance. Every new call clears this 
 * error condition. So if user code needs to check if a given method returned an error, it 
 * simply calls the LastError() method, which returns a copy of the stored error object. This 
 * way, when things are working, the code becomes more readable and intuitive, allowing 
 * algorithms to be uncluterred by constant error checks. On the other hand, quick 
 * debugging is made easy through the insertion of a simple safe call right after the 
 * suspicious one. 
 * 
 * Time references in MuM 
 * 
 * Time in MuM may be approached in two different ways. Let's call these strategies relative 
 * and absolute. While the library is flexible enough to allow mixing them together, it is 
 * probably wiser to choose one or the other for a given project, in order to avoid confusion 
 * and extra maintenance work. For each one of these approaches, MuM provides a group of 
 * methods that facilitate the handling of time related issues. 
 * 
 * The first option is to treat each material object as having its own independent time (relative 
 * time reference). In order to do this we need to assign the first note of our materials a start 
 * time of 0 (zero). The following notes then take the necessary start values to create the 
 * desired rhythmic patterns. In other words, each material should be treated as a whole 
 * which exists in isolation. These "standalone" pieces can then be pasted into other pieces 
 * with the help of methods such as Insert(), Append() and others like them, in order to build 
 * larger materials, which eventually merge into one composition. This approach is 
 * somewhat easier to deal with as it models a more intuitive version of music materials, one 
 * which we are used to see in traditional composition. For instance, we may want to take a 
 * certain melody and use it in various places in the composition. So we store this 
 * progression using start time information which places every note in the 'correct' place in 
 * relation to the first note. Then, when assembling the composition, we copy that melody to 
 * the desired spots, by inserting the material into a main material which serves as main 
 * storage area for the composition. 
 * 
 * The second approach to timing is to adopt an absolute reference. This means thinking of all 
 * materials as sharing the same time line. To handle this kind of time treatment, we need to 
 * use a group of methods to move each material to the right position in time, within itself, 
 * and then mix all the materials together in order to build the complete work.  *
